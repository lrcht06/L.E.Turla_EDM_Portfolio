This portfolio highlights the application of data normalization and cleaning in a transactional database. The dataset includes several related tables, each structured to optimize data organization and remove redundancy.
## STEP 1. Data Cleaning Process
- Load the raw file
- Fix collumns width and height
- TRIM words and spaces
- Remove Null values
- Remove Duplicates
## STEP 2. Normalization
- Performed 1NF
- Perform Tablet spilt using 2NF
- Performed 2NF
- Mapped the normalization as a physical data model

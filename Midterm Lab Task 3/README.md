# Midterm Lab Task 3
This portfolio highlights the application of data normalization and cleaning in a transactional database. The dataset includes several related tables, each structured to optimize data organization and remove redundancy.
## STEP 1. Data Cleaning Process
- Load the raw dataset
- Adjust column width and height
- Trim extra spaces and inconsistencies
- Remove null values and fix "inf" errors
- Eliminate duplicate records
## STEP 2. Normalization
- Apply First Normal Form (1NF)
- Split tables according to Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Implement Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Structure data into a relational model
